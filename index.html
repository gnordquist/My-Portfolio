          <p><strong>I am an aspiring Software Engineer living in Auburn, WA.</strong></p>
          <p>I currently attend Western Governors University pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. So far,
            it has been a wonderful process and I look forward to what is to come.</p>
        
          <p><strong>As a future Software Engineer, I am interested in:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Being a part of something meaningful.</li>
            <!-- line breaks! (<br>)-->
            <li>Networking and meeting like-minded individuals that challenge and encourage me to
            learn and grow.</li>
            <li>Developing myself both personally and professionally.</li>

        <h2>About Gabrielle</h2>
        
        <p>I was introduced to Software Engineering about a year ago through some of my family and friends. I knew
 of it, but never really knew the intricacies that lay behind it. Anything to do with a computer, other than 
          the basics, was relatively foreign to me.</p>
        
        <p>However, as the onset of COVID occurred, I came to realize that my (then) current career wasn't what I was
 looking for concerning my future. It wasn't stable, nor challenging enough, so I figured I would look into what
 Computer Science really was. I was intrigued. I watched many videos, read a couple books on JavaScript and HTML/CSS just
 to see if I liked it or not. After a short amount of time, I came out with a strong desire to learn
 more. I thoroughly <em>enjoy</em> coding - and now, I don't run away from computers anymore!</p>

        <p>I decided that I wanted to be the student once again, and learn something <em>au courant</em>,
 something completely new and relevant. My newfound passion for programming developed quickly,
 and I finally seem to have found a forever challenge in an ever-changing field that excites me. As I go through my journey 
 in acquiring my B.S, I hope to be able to be a part of a team as an intern to really get a sense of the responsibilities I'll
 have and the culture I hope to be a part of someday. I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, along with years of experience
 working productively in teams. I also have real world experience in high stakes analytical problem solving from working in management in the retail
 industry for over 5 years. Through actions, I hope my work ethic and motivation will prove what a valuable member of the team I can be.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        
        <p>At thestart of my journey, I have completed a few projects as described below. Some I did on my own free time, where others were 
          designated school projects that proved very helpful in learning to code in other languages.</p>
        <p><strong>Projects I have completed and are available on my <a href="https://github.com/gnordquist" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student Roster Project</li>
          <li>RandAm Sandler</li>
          <li>Browser Battleship</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Student Roster Project I created was done in the language C++.	It is a class-based student roster. Objects
          are housed in working memory and there are methods which can create, retrieve or manipulate the student roster. This project was a lot of
          fun to work on because this was my most involved program that involved multiple files in a completely new language to me (at the time).</p>
        
        <p>RandAm Sandler is a funny little program I wrote in Java for my friends and myself to queue up our next great Adam Sandler movie to
          watch when we all get together. Simply put, it is a random movie generator of Adam Sandlerâ€™s best 90s and 2000s movies, in my opinion of course!</p>
        
        <p>Browser Battleship is an emulation of the classic board game Battleship. I loved this game as a kid, and through learning JavaScript,
          HTML, and CSS through the "Head First" books, I was able to make this browser game.</p>
