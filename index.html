        <h2>About Gabrielle</h2>
        
        <p>I was introduced to Software Engineering about a year ago through some of my family and friends. I knew
 of it, but never really knew the intricacies that lay behind it. Anything to do with a computer, other than 
the basics, was relatively foreign to me. 
        
        <p>However, as the onset of COVID occurred, I came to realize that my (then)current career wasn't what I was
 looking for concerning my future. It wasn't stable, nor challenging enough, so I figured I would look into what
 Computer Science really was. I was intrigued. I watched many videos, read a couple books on JavaScript and HTML/CSS just
 to see if I liked it or not. After a short amount of time, I came out with a strong desire to learn
 more. I thoroughly <em>enjoy</em> coding - and now, I don't run away from computers anymore! </p>

        <p>I decided that I wanted to be the student once again, and learn something <em>au courant</em>,
 something completely new and relevant. My newfound passion for programming developed quickly,
 and I finally seem to have found a forever challenge in an ever-changing field that excites me.</p>

        <p>Some fun facts about me include that I love ALL things outdoors. On my weekends, you will find me hiking or
 backpacking, rock climbing, going for a run, or swimming, or gaming. Like coding, anything outside in nature brings me
 immense joy. The perfect place for all of these things are the National Parks. I am a frequent visitor of them, and often
 find that the best trails are the ones you pave yourself! In better conditions, (sans COVID) I
 would be training for my next marathon in hopes of qualifying for the Boston marathon. It has always been a dream of mine
 to compete in that race, as well as the Ironman triathlon. Further, I am also a lover of gardening and
 plants. My home is filled to the brim with them! There is just something about having grown your own food and admiring the
 beauty that is nature within the confines of your own home.</p>
