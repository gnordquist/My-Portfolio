        <h2>About Gabrielle</h2>
        <p>I have worked in the retail industry for over 5 years. It has taught me a lot, and I was able to work
           my way "up the food chain" so-to-speak, relatively quickly. Over 3 of the 5 or so years have been in 
           a leadership role with a team under me. I loved this because I enjoy teaching and being able to rely 
           on my team, and them on me. Working with others is truly gratifying, and has always been very rewarding- 
           it is something I will always seek in a job of mine. However, I have come to realize that my current line
           of work isn't stable, nor challenging enough, so I thought, how could I keep it as my career?</p>
        <p>I decided that I wanted to be the student once again, and learn something <em>au courant</em>, something 
           completely new and relevant, several months ago. My newfound passion for programming developed quickly, 
           and I finally seem to have found a forever challenge in an ever-changing field that excites me.</p>
         <!-- Thinkful link inside of this paragraph-->
        <p>Insert <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank"/>Thinkful</a>. After lots of research, wondering 
           whether or not I should go back to school, I decided to attend a Bootcamp that will help to accelerate my 
           learning, and in turn, fully introduce me into my new career. Now, with full confidence, I can say that I 
           am on the path to becoming a successful Software Engineer!</p>
