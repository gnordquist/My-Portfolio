          <p><strong>I am an aspiring Software Engineer living in Sacramento, CA.</strong></p>
          <p>As a manager in the retail industry, the introduction of new tech has opened my eyes to all

realized this sooner!</p>
        
          <p><strong>As a future Software Engineer, I am interested in:</strong></p>
          <ul>

        <h2>About Gabrielle</h2>
        
        <p>I was introduced to Web Development about a year ago through some of my family and friends. I knew
 of it, but never really knew the intricacies that lay behind it. Anything to do with a computer, other than 
the basics, was relatively foreign to me. 
        
        <p>However, as the onset of COVID occurred, I came to realize that my current career wasn't what I was
 looking for concerning my future. It wasn't stable, nor challenging enough, so I figured I would look into what
 Web Development really was. I was intrigued. I watched many videos, read a couple books on JavaScript and HTML/CSS just
 to see if I liked it or not. After a short amount of time, I came out with a strong desire to learn
 more. I thoroughly <em>enjoy</em> coding - and now, I don't run away from computers anymore! </p>

        <p>So, I decided that I wanted to be the student once again, and learn something <em>au courant</em>,
 something completely new and relevant, several months ago. My newfound passion for programming developed quickly,
 and I finally seem to have found a forever challenge in an ever-changing field that excites me.</p>

         <!-- Thinkful link inside of this paragraph-->
        <p><a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, a coding Bootcamp, is now giving me the
 wonderful opportunity to learn web development in depth, and the opportunity of being able to do so whilst working
 alongside others. Come the end of their Bootcamp, I look forward to being a part of field that is challenging and
 promotes the same kind of team work that I have come to love in my current, and soon past, line of work. The benefits
 of breaking down small problems to find the bigger solution is far better when you have many minds working together.
 Not only that, but in a team, you're able to collaborate effectively, build structure, create motivation, you can find
 more creative or efficient ways of doing something, as well as being able to highlight certain individuals strengths.
 I am excited about being in this kind of position of teamwork to complete a goal together again. I recognize that I am new to this field,
but I look forward to the insights and knowledge that others have to offer. Working with a team is simply rewarding. Notably, however,
 when one is able to share their achievements, often the whole groups achievements, 
together. I could not be more thrilled to be a part of an environment like this again.</p>

        <p>Some fun facts about me include that I love ALL things outdoors. On my weekends, you will find me hiking or
 backpacking with my dog, rock climbing, going for a run, or swimming. Like coding, anything outside in nature brings me
 immense joy. The perfect place for all of these things are the National Parks. I am a frequent visitor of them, and often
 find that the best trails are the ones you pave yourself! In better conditions, (sans COVID and the California fires) I
 would be training for my next marathon in hopes of qualifying for the Boston marathon. It has always been a dream of mine
 to compete in that race, as well as the Ironman triathlon. Further, I am also a lover of gardening and
 plants. My home is filled to the brim with them! There is just something about having grown your own food and admiring the
 beauty that is nature within the confines of your own home.</p>
